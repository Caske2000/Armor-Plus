##What is Armor Plus?

Armor Plus is this cool mod which adds in a special type of armor: Customizable Armor. Some customizabilities are the Auto-Feeder, Death Protection and Bad Potion Remover. This all comes at a price of course: Redstone Flux.

PS: Keep in mind that this mod is this in active development, so if there is anything you don't like, just leave me a message on the MinecraftForum (or another medium)

## Installation Instructions

Since this mod is based on the 'Minecraft Forge API' it's very simple to install.

Step 1) Download [Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/) for Minecraft (I recommend to download the "Recommended" version) and install it. If you encounter a problem whilst trying to install Forge, just consult Google or YouTube, it has all of your answers ;)

Step 2) Download the latest version of Armor Plus (see Links: CurseForge)

Step 2.5) It's currently neccessairy to also have to mod BuildCraft installed, so download it as well

Step 3) Just place the mod file in the 'mods' folder of your .minecraft directory.
